### Goals
[Top][]

MediaScape targets applications that provide shared experiences across multiple devices.

This library builds awareness about the device features and the available devices ready to be connected for each application instance. To achieve it, the MediaScape Discovery library must introspect the features of the device and detect the reachable devices through the possible network interfaces and communication protocols.

### Structure
[Top][]

The generic structure of each WP repository is:

  * API: The JavaScript API.
  * complements: additional elements for extra and optional features.
  * helloworld: minimal sample code.
