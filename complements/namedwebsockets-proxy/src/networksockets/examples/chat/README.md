Named WebSockets Chat Demo
===

A simple chat client on top of [Named WebSockets](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/namedwebsockets).

#### Running the example

1. Ensure the Named WebSockets Proxy has been downloaded and is currently running on your local machine. You can download pre-built Named WebSocket Proxy binaries [here](https://github.com/namedwebsockets/namedwebsockets/releases).

    NOTE: Ultimately, this step should not be required with all proxy functionality implemented within user agents.

2. Open [`chat.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/namedwebsockets/examples/chat/chat.html) in a browser window.

3. Open [`chat.html`](http://namedwebsockets.github.io/namedwebsockets/examples/chat/chat.html) in another browser window on the local machine or on another device that is also running a Named WebSockets proxy in the local network.

4. Send messages from one chat window and watch the chat message appear in the other chat window (and vice-versa).
